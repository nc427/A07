            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization
            that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors.
            Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally reowned,
            thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain
            our audience! As one of our members told us:</p>
            <p>        Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.
            </p>
